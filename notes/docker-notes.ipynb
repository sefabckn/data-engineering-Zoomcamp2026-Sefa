    "### **What is Docker?**\n",
    "A containerization tool that packages your entire application (code + dependencies + runtime) into a **single, portable box** that works everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Your Laptop → Docker Container → Production Server\n",
    "     ✅ Works                    ✅ Works\n",

    "### **Why Docker Matters for Data Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Problem | Docker Solution |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|\n",
    "| \"Works on my machine\" | Runs identically everywhere |\n",
    "| Dependency conflicts | Isolated environments |\n",
    "| Hard to scale | Easy horizontal scaling |\n",
    "| Slow onboarding | Instant setup with `docker-compose up` |\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🏗️ **Image vs Container**\n",
    "- **Image**: Blueprint (like a recipe)\n",
    "- **Container**: Running instance (like a cooked meal)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Build image\n",
    "docker build -t my-app:1.0 .\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run container from image\n",
    "docker run -d -p 5432:5432 my-app:1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📚 **Layer Caching (The Speedup Trick)**\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.13-slim          # Layer 1: Base image\n",
    "COPY requirements.txt .         # Layer 2: Dependencies\n",
    "RUN pip install -r requirements # Layer 3: Install (SLOW)\n",
    "COPY app.py .                   # Layer 4: Code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why order matters:**\n",
    "- Dependencies change rarely → Cache stays valid\n",
    "- Code changes often → But dependencies are already cached\n",
    "- **Result**: 30s rebuild instead of 5 minutes! ⚡\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔗 **Docker Compose: Multiple Containers**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  postgres:    # Database service\n",
    "  pgadmin:     # UI for database\n",
    "  app:         # Your application\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Magic:** Services communicate by name (`postgres:5432`), volumes persist data, networks are automatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏢 Terraform: Infrastructure as Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Terraform?**\n",
    "Instead of clicking buttons in cloud dashboards, you **write code to describe infrastructure**. Version control your infrastructure like code!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Manual clicking → Terraform code → Version controlled → Reproducible\n",
    "  (Error-prone)     (Organized)       (No surprises)    (CI/CD ready)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Terraform Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Reproducible**: Deploy same infrastructure 100x identically\n",
    "✅ **Version Control**: Track infra changes like Git commits\n",
    "✅ **Teamwork**: Collaborate on infrastructure safely\n",
    "✅ **Cloud Agnostic**: AWS → GCP → Azure (mostly) without changing code\n",
    "✅ **Scaling**: Spin up 100 servers with a variable change\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Building Blocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔧 **Provider** (Which cloud?)\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "terraform {\n",
    "  required_providers {\n",
    "    google = {\n",
    "      source = \"hashicorp/google\"\n",

    "  region  = \"us-central1\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📦 **Resource** (What to create?)\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "resource \"google_storage_bucket\" \"data_lake\" {\n",
    "  name     = \"my-data-lake-bucket\"\n",
    "  location = \"US\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎛️ **Variables** (Parameterize everything!)\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "variable \"project_id\" {\n",
    "  default = \"my-project\"\n",
    "  type    = string\n",

    "### **Terraform Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. terraform init     → Download providers & plugins\n",
    "2. terraform plan     → Show what WILL change (review carefully!)\n",
    "3. terraform apply    → Actually create/modify resources\n",
    "4. terraform destroy  → Tear down everything (careful in prod!)\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Pro Tip**: Always run `plan` before `apply` to avoid surprises!\n",

    "## 💡 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Docker**\n",
    "1. **Think in containers**: One container = one concern (DB, app, cache)\n",
    "2. **Layer efficiently**: Put changing stuff last\n",
    "3. **Use compose locally**: Test full stack before deploying\n",
    "4. **Never hardcode secrets**: Use environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Terraform**\n",
    "1. **Code your infrastructure**: No more clicking in dashboards\n",
    "2. **Use variables**: Make code reusable across environments\n",
    "3. **Plan before apply**: Read the plan output carefully!\n",
    "4. **State files are gold**: Treat `terraform.tfstate` like a database backup\n",
    "5. **Version your infra**: Commit `.tf` files to Git\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Engineering Perspective**\n",
    "- **Docker** = reproducible applications\n",
    "- **Terraform** = reproducible infrastructure\n",
    "- **Together** = fully reproducible data pipelines\n",
